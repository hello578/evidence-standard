      <p>
        The Evidence Standard is a published framework for defining how evidence
        of judgement and decision-making may be captured and verified at the
        moment it is exercised.
      </p>

      <p>
        It establishes shared principles intended to support audit,
        regulatory, insurance, and governance scrutiny.
