        Standards published under the Evidence Standard are intended to be
        stable, conservative, and versioned deliberately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Changes are documented, versioned, and published transparently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Evidence Standard provides an umbrella framework under which
        individual published standards, such as VES, may be maintained.
